                    <p>For the Fast track NVQ Diploma, the training Course is free to the employer, supported by reimbursement from a partner organisation, upon learner completion of the training.</p>

                    <p>The Fast Track Diploma benefits from a faster completion timescale without having to fulfil a mandatory timeframe (as is the case with apprenticeships).

Much reduced administration at sign up and throughout the training if compared to the apprenticeship with no Ofsted or college inspections or involvement during the entire process.</p>
